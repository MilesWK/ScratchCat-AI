> [!WARNING]
> The AI has been banned for "tricking the community." For those who reported the bot thinking it was a human. It was indeed AI. The source code proves it. I have appealed the ban, but it might take some time for it to get fixed, if it will. If you want to watch this issue, please set your watch status on this repository to "All activity." Thank you for your support.
